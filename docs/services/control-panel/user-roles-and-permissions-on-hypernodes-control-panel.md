# User Roles and Permissions on Hypernode’s Control Panel

For security and usability, the Hypernode Control Panel's features are available to users based on the role assigned to the individual user. Each user invited to a team is assigned a role within the team.

## The Different Control Panel Roles

A user can have different roles between teams. Each role is defined by a set of permissions. The permissions, based on the specific role, apply to all Hypernodes in a team. This also includes the SSL certificates that have been linked to the Hypernodes in the team.

- **Owner:** Can access and use every feature. This is the most powerful role and cannot be assigned. The Owner is the only one who can transfer the ownership of the Hypernode you can read more about this [here](how-to-transfer-ownership-of-a-hypernode-in-the-control-panel.md). The user creating the Team is automatically the Owner. The Owner is the person in charge of billing.
- **Admin:** Can use all features and [change Hypernode plans](../../about-hypernode/billing/how-to-up-or-downgrade-your-hypernode-plan.md#up--and-downgrading-your-hosting-plan-for-control-panel-users). They can invite other team members and set or change roles of team members.
- **Developer:** Can manage all technical features on a Hypernode level.
- **Merchant:** Can access the Control Panel on a view-only basis.
