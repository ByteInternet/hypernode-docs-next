# How to Use 2FA on the Control Panel

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), also called two-step verification, adds an extra layer of security to your Hypernode Control Panel account. Instead of signing in with only a password, you also confirm your identity with a one-time code from your authentication app.

This makes it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access your account, even if your password is compromised.

## How 2FA Works:

- You need access to your mobile device when signing in.
- After entering your password, you are asked for a 6-digit verification code.
- The code is generated by an authentication app on your phone.
- You can choose **“Remember this device for 30 days”** to avoid entering a code on that device for the next 30 days.

## What You Need Before Enabling 2FA

You must install an authentication app on your mobile device. Common options include:

- Google Authenticator
- Okta Verify
- Duo Mobile
- Authy
- 1Password

Any app that supports time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) will work.

## How to Enable 2FA

1. Sign in to the Hypernode Control Panel. 
1. Hover over your username in the top-right corner.
1. Select **Account settings**.
1. Click **Manage 2FA**.
1. Scan the QR code using your authentication app. You can also choose to enter the setup key manually. 
1. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by your app. 
1. Click **Confirm** to finish setup.

Once enabled, you will receive a confirmation email and the action will be logged in your account activity.

## Disabling 2FA

For security reasons, 2FA can no longer be disabled directly from the Control Panel.

If you need to disable 2FA, please contact Hypernode Support at **support@hypernode.com**.

## Backup Codes

During setup, you receive a set of backup codes. These are important.

- Each backup code can be used only once.
- Backup codes allow you to sign in if you lose access to your phone or authentication app. 
- You can always find your backup codes on your **Account** page.

We strongly recommend storing these codes somewhere safe and offline.

## Security Notice

If you receive a verification code that you did not request, someone may be trying to access your account.

In that case:
- Log in to your account immediately.
- Change your password.
- Contact Hypernode Support if you suspect unauthorized activity.

If you lose access to your authentication app and do not have backup codes, contact **support@hypernode.com** for assistance.
