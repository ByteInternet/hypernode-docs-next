# How To Use Teams

With teams you can invite other users to manage your Hypernode and it gives you much finer-grained control over who has access to your Hypernode. In this documentation we describe how you can manage your teams.

Weâ€™ve distinguished three scenarios: inviting a developer, a merchant or an agency. If a team member (not the owner) extends an invitation, the owner will also be notified.

## Creating a Team

To create a new team:

1. Log into the [Control Panel](https://my.hypernode.com).
1. From sidebar on the left, click **Teams**.
1. Click **Create a new Team**.
1. Give the team a name.
1. Optional: Invite other members. You can also invite members after creating a team.
1. Optional: select one or more available Hypernodes that should be handled by your new team. You can also add Hypernodes to your team afterwards.
1. Click **Create team**.

You will now see the team detail page from which you can invite new members, change linked Hypernodes, and modify the name.

## Deleting a Team

Please note you can only delete a team if you're the creator of the team. If you want to leave the team, you can do it by removing yourself from the members from particular team.

1. From sidebar on the left, click **Teams**.
1. Click on the **trash can** behind the team you want to delete.

## Adding Hypernodes to a Team

To add Hypernode to an existing team:

1. From sidebar on the left, click **Teams**.
1. Go to the Team you want to manage.
1. Click on **Edit linked Hypernodes**.
1. Select one or more Hypernodes you want to associate with this Team. Keep in mind all members will be able to access this Hypernode depending on their roles.

## Manage Users in a Team

There are three different roles you can assign to members to members of your team. Each role is defined by a set of permissions. The permissions, based on the specific role, apply to all Hypernodes in a team. This also includes the SSL certificates that have been linked to the Hypernodes in the team. For detailed information on what those roles are and which permissions they have, please click [here](user-roles-and-permissions-on-hypernodes-control-panel.md).

### Inviting a Member

To add a new developer:

1. Log into the Hypernode Control Panel.
1. From the sidebar on the left, click **Teams**.
1. Go to the Team you want to manage.
1. Click **Invite new member**.
1. Fill in their email, select the desired role, and click **Send invitation**.

An invitation will be sent to the invitee's email address. Once they have accepted the invitation, the owner and inviting member will be notified of this via email.

### Revoking Access

1. Log into the Hypernode Control Panel.
1. From the sidebar on the left, click **Teams**.
1. Go to the Team you want to manage.
1. Delete a member by clicking the trash can. Confirm the removal.
1. Note: If you don't see a trashcan it means you don't have permissions to remove members.

Once you remove someone from a team, you can always use Invite new member to add them back to the team later on. A notification will be sent to the owner if another team member revoked access for another team member.
