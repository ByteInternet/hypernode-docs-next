You don't need to add a new SPF record if you already have one (for example for your Hypernode) you can just edit the current one (with the pencil icon) and add the Outlook value to the current record

Please note that if you had created email boxes and email addresses at Hypernode, you must delete them. You can do this under **Instellingen > Email**in the Service Panel. Make sure to [export the emails](../../best-practices/email/how-to-export-your-emails.md) in the inbox if you want to save them to your new Office365 account before deleting the accounts at Hypernode.
