# Object Storage

Hypernode Object Storage provides an option to store media files, assets, backups, documents, etc in a persistent, remote storage container.

Object storage eliminates redundancy and provides a centralized, scalable solution for storing application assets, session data, and backups.

By default, media files are stored in the same filesystem that contains the application. This is inefficient for complex, multi-server configurations, and can result in degraded performance when sharing resources.

With Object Storage you get:

- Effortless Data Sharing – Seamless access across all Hypernodes
- Full Access Control & Security – Secure and manage your data with ease
- Safe Backup & Monitoring – Ensure reliability with built-in insights
