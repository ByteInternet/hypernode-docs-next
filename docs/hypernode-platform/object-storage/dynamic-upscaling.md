# Dynamic Upscaling

Dynamic Upscaling is a feature that automatically increases your object storage capacity when needed. This ensures that your workspace always has enough space to store your files, backups, media, and other dataâ€”without requiring manual upgrades.

## How it works

When Dynamic Upscaling is enabled, the system monitors your usage and upgrades your object storage plan automatically when you're close to hitting the limit. This helps prevent issues related to running out of storage space and reduces the risk of downtime. Dynamic upscaling will always choose the next suitable plan size based on your current usage. You will be billed according to the upgraded plan after the change.

## Managing Dynamic Upscaling

Dynamic Upscaling can be enabled or disabled through the Control Panel.

Go to the Control Panel, select the Object Storage workspace you want to enable/disable Dynamic Upscaling for, and toggle the Dynamic Upscaling switch.
