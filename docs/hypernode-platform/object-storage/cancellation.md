# Cancellation

To cancel an Object Storage Workspace, you can SSH into the Hypernode that is linked to that Object Storage and run `hypernode-object-storage cancel`.

```{note}
The cancellation will be in effect from the end of the month.
Also if you change your mind or forgot to pull some data. It will still be available for 7 days after the cancellation. You can always reach out to the support team for help if that happens.
```
