# How to Enable horizontal Autoscaling?

## What is horizontal Autoscaling?

Horizontal autoscaling in other words means upgrading the amount of resources when your Hypernode needs it, so you donâ€™t need to worry about constant monitoring.

The amount of resources your Hypernode will upgrade with, is calculated by our agent based on the requirements.

The upgrade is effective as long the extra resources are needed and being used. For more technical overview you can check our docs [How Horizontal Autoscaling Works](how-does-horizontal-autoscaling-work.md).
