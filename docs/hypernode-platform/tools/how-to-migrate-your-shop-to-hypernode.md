# How to Migrate Your Shop to Hypernode

![Step 2 - Copy your shop to Hypernode](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48023612566/original/RVSFfRgQvCqHofVt1b6KSSqmK_WI6QwyPA.png?1579610273)

Congratulations with your brand new Hypernode! In case you already have a shop, the first step is to migrate your shop to Hypernode in order to test it. There are several ways to achieve this, which are described below.

\***Please note that the `hypernode-importer` is compatible with the following shop types:**

- Magento 1
- Magento 2
- Shopware 5
- Shopware 6

Before importing your shop, make sure your [vhost](../nginx/hypernode-managed-vhosts.md) is of the right `type`. You can verify that by listing the existing vhosts with the following command: `hypernode-manage-vhosts --list`. This will generate a list of every vhost, their type and some additional information that might be interesting.

If your vhost isn't the right `type`, you should chance the type of the vhost. You can achieve this by the following command:

```bash
hypernode-manage-vhosts example.com --type TYPE
```

## Option 1: for Service Panel users: Use the Shop Importer on [service.byte.nl](https://service.byte.nl)

**Service Panel** customers have access to the importer tool via [service.byte.nl](https://service.byte.nl).
If you use the Shop importer on our Service Panel, all you have to do is to fill in the correct information on the form, click "Importeer shop" and in the background your shop will be automatically imported on your Hypernode.

If you use the Shop importer on our Service Panel, locally on the node the `hypernode-importer` utility is ran. This is a fully scripted migration tool that executes all the tasks that need to be done when migrating a shop. This includes:

- Copying the database
- Copying all the content
- Replacing caching through `memcached` with `Redis`
- Adjusting symlinks and paths
- Repairing the modman directory if existent
- Set old/current shop in Maintenance mode
- And several other options.

### Selecting the Maintenance Mode in the Shop Importer Tool

Please only select this option if you run the Importer tool for the second time, to do a last sync before going live on Hypernode.

When you select the maintenance box in the importer tool in the Service Panel, the importer wil create a maintenance flag (file: maintenance.flag) in the root of your current/old Magento shop (this function isn't Shopware compatible yet). Please be aware that your current website won't be available for your visitors. When the migration has been finished you need to modify your DNS settings:

\*If your domain is hosted at Hypernode, there is a quick and easy way to switch your DNS to the Hypernode. Login into the [Service Panel](https://service.byte.nl). Make sure your Hypernode is selected in the dropdown menu -> Instellingen -> SSL & DNS instellingen -> Find your domain in the list -> change the 'Beschikbaar' value into 'Koppel domeinnaam aan deze Hypernode'. Repeat these steps for all the domains that should be linked to your Hypernode.

\*If your domain is being hosted externally, you need to change the DNS settings manually. Read [this article](../dns/how-to-manage-your-dns-settings-for-hypernode.md)to see which records you need to modify.

\*Although the Shop importer is a very easy way to import a shop, please keep in mind that is using the command line is a requirement. So if needed, find yourself an [experienced developer](https://www.byte.nl/partners#specialisms=Hypernode&cms=Magento) that can assist you with these tasks.

\*The import isn't 100% foolproof so there could be situations in which it doesn't work and you'd have to use the importer-tool via the Shell.

## Option 2: for all Customers: Migrate Your Shop via Shell Using the `hypernode-importer`

Are you a Control Panel (my.hypernode.com)user? Please use the Hypernode Importer tool via Shell.
*The `hypernode-importer` tool is suitable for both Magento 1 and 2 shops as well as for Shopware 5 and 6 shops*

This tool executes the following tasks:

- Copying the database
- Copying all the content
- Replacing caching through `memcached` with `Redis`
- Adjusting symlinks and paths
- Repairing the modman directory if existent
- And several other options.

The `hypernode-importer` is a very comprehensive tool as it has several alternative options and scenario's. You can import from a local database dump, use a local compressed file, copying additional databases, setting maintenance mode on the source server and skipping files that should not be copied. Please use the `hypernode-importer --help` flag to list all available options.

Please follow these steps:

- [Log in to your Hypernode with SSH](../ssh/how-to-log-in-to-the-hypernode-with-ssh.md)
- Use the `hypernode-importer`to automatically migrate the shop to your Hypernode. All data currently on your Hypernode will be overwritten. Its usage is simple:
  - `--host` Enter the SSH hostname
  - `--user` Enter the SSH user
  - `--path` Enter the full path to the rootfolder of the shop
  - `--port`\* Enter the SSH-portnumber, if not given is uses the default: 22
  - `--set-default-url`\* Sets the Base-URL to *<http://APPNAME.hypernode>.io/*
  - `--skip-db-import`\* Skips the database import
  - `--skip-file-import`\* Skips the files import
  - Use `--help` to list additional options

\*\* these are optional\*

- Example command: `hypernode-importer --host SSH_HOSTNAME --user SSH_USER --path /full/path/to/shop --set-default-url`
- Sit back while we do the work :-)

## Done Migrating?

Done? Now it's time to [check if everything works](../../best-practices/testing/how-to-check-if-everything-works.md) as it should!

## Tips and Tricks

- You could also use `screen` or `tmux` to migrate your shop in a terminal session. Use `man screen` or `man tmux` to learn more about these commands.
- The Shop importer first uses `rsync` to copy the file content and retrieves the database credentials required to dump the database from the copied configuration files. This implies that if you already imported another shop before, you should first remove the old content of the other shop before migrating a new one.

*Starting over and need a fresh Magento or Shopware install? With the `preinstall` option can start over with just one single command*
