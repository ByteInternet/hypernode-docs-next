# How to order a Domain/Presence plan

To order a domain at Hypernode you need a Presence plan. We offer two different Presence plans:

**Presence 1 year (€19,95 a year ex. VAT)** This plan includes:

- 1 Domain name registration
- 100 email aliasses
- forwarding services

**Presence Plus (€ 83,40 a year ex. VAT)** This plan includes:

- 1 Domain name registration
- 2000 email aliasses
- 100 mailboxes
- forwarding services

## How to Order

To order one of these plans, please follow the steps below:

1. Log into the [Hypernode control panel](https://my.hypernode.com/domain/)
1. Go to the 'Domains' tab and press Order domain
1. Enter the domain name that you want to register with/transfer to Hypernode.
1. When you want to transfer a domain, our ordering system will recognize you want to order an existing domain and will ask you if you want to transfer the domain. This step will not initiate a transfer. If you want to transfer the domain to Hypernode you can choose the option 'Domein + hosting verhuizen' if you only want to order a Presence Plan but you have no plans for transferring the domain name you can choose the option 'Hosting only verhuizen'
1. Select the plan you need.
1. Click on 'Controleren & Afronden'
   1. If you already have an account with Hypernode you can either login and complete the order.
   1. If you do not have an account yet, we will ask you to register. After that you can complete the order.
1. After completing your order you can either transfer your domain or our system will register the domain.
