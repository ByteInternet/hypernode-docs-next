# How to order a Domain/Presence plan

To order a domain at Hypernode you need a Presence plan. We offer two different Presence plans:

* 1 Domain name registration
* 100 email aliasses
* forwarding services

**Presence Plus (€ 83,40 a year ex. VAT)** This plan includes:

* 1 Domain name registration
* 2000 email aliasses
* 100 mailboxes
* forwarding services

How to Order
------------

To order one of these plans, please follow the steps below:

1. Go to <https://service.byte.nl/bestellen2/>
2. Enter the domain name that you want to register with/transfer to Hypernode.
