# Hypernode Docker

The official Hypernode Docker image for Magento development is now available. This image can be used to set up a fast and easy local development environment for Hypernode, or as a build machine in a CI environment representative of the production environment. The image contains the exact same packages and configuration as a real Hypernode except for some Docker specific tweaks. By testing and developing against this image you can be sure that when you deploy to a Hypernode in production there will be no surprises because of different software versions or configurations.

## About the Hypernode Docker Image

We build this image multiple times a day (every time we do a [release](https://changelog.hypernode.com/)) by applying our configuration management on the [phusion/baseimage-docker](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker) ["fat" container](https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/baseimage-docker-fat-containers-treating-containers-vms/). By treating the Docker as a lightweight VM instead of as a vehicle for a single process we stay close to what an actual Hypernode actually looks like. No micro-services or a multi-container application, but a single instance with minimal network overhead and all batteries included.

The `hypernode-docker` image has SSH, PHP, NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Varnish and Elasticsearch. The biggest difference between a real Hypernode and this container is that this environment does not have an [init system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init). While it is possible to [run systemd within a Docker Container](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/05/05/running-systemd-within-docker-container/) if the host is also runs [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/), we choose not to do so to achieve greater compatibility and user-friendliness.

## Usage

First of all download the latest version of Docker for Windows or Mac from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and make sure to install Docker on your computer. If you are working with Linux you can find all the info to install Docker in their documentation [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/install).

Now you need to decide which \*\*[image](https://github.com/byteinternet/hypernode-docker)\*\*you need. We've several images, all with other PHP and MySQL versions. After you decided which images fits your requirements you can pull the image to your local machine and start a new Docker container. In the below example we used the image "hypernode-bookworm-docker-php84-mysql80". If you need another you can change that name in both commands below to the image you want to use.

### Start the Docker and logging in

Starting a container

```bash
docker pull docker.hypernode.com/byteinternet/hypernode-bookworm-docker-php84-mysql80:latest
docker run -p 222:22 -p 8080:80 -p 8025:8025 docker.hypernode.com/byteinternet/hypernode-bookworm-docker-php84-mysql80:latest
```

This makes the SSH, HTTP, and Mailhog ports available on the localhost. If you need any other ports (Such as 443 for HTTPS, or 2222 for sftp) available, you can insert these in the command above. In this example you should use the following command to connect to the container:

```bash
# Login as app user, obviously you can replace "app" with "root" to login as root
ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -p 222 app@127.0.0.1
```

The password is ‘*insecure_docker_ssh_password*’.

**Checker whether or not you're are in the Docker environment**

```console
app@e4b7d958e69c:~$ ls /etc/hypernode/is_docker
/etc/hypernode/is_docker
```

Now you're ready to use the hypernode-importer to import a shop from a remote server.

```bash
hypernode-importer --host yourhypernode.hypernode.io --path /data/web/public --set-default-url
```

To see the container in your browser you should change the base-url to “[http://127.0.0.1:8080/”](http://127.0.0.1:8080/%E2%80%9D) and don’t forget to flush your cache afterwards:

#### Magento 1

[How to change base-urls in Magento 1](../../ecommerce-applications/magento-1/how-to-change-the-base-url-in-magento-1-x.md)

```bash
magerun ca:fl
```

#### Magento 2

[How to change base-url in Magento 2](../../ecommerce-applications/magento-2/how-to-change-your-magento-2-base-urls.md)

```bash
cd magento2
magerun2 ca:fl
```

#### **General Docker Commands**

You might want to start several docker containers to develop multiple webshops. These commands may come in handy:

```bash
# Get the container ID of the Hypernode docker
HN_CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aq -f "ancestor=docker.hypernode.com/byteinternet/hypernode-docker:latest")

# Find the IP address of the container
docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' $HN_CONTAINER_ID
172.17.0.2

# Run/Start container
docker start 9187ce8348b0

# Stop container
docker stop 9187ce8348b0

# Remove container (container must be stop before it could be removed)
docker rm 9187ce8348b0
```

### Restarting services

Because `systemctl` is not available inside the container, the services are started by an [init script](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker#running-scripts-during-container-startup) on container startup. Note that because the systemd unit files are not parsed there could be a slight drift between what commandline flags the processes actually use in production compared to in this contanier.

To restart all services run:

```bash
bash /etc/my_init.d/60_restart_services.sh
```

If you only want to restart a specific service, inspect the restart_services.sh script and kill the screen for the service you want to restart. Then run the corresponding screen command to start the service again.

## Starting the container

### Running the container on the foreground

To start the container in the foreground, run the following command:

```console
$ docker pull docker.hypernode.com/byteinternet/hypernode-docker:latest
$ docker run -p 222:22 -p 8080:80 -p 8025:8025 docker.hypernode.com/byteinternet/hypernode-docker:latest

### Running The Container on The Background

To start the container in the background, run the following command:

```console
$ docker run -d -p 222:22 -p 8080:80 -p 8025:8025 docker.hypernode.com/byteinternet/hypernode-docker:latest

```

The IP address of the container can then be found with:

```console
$ docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' 36532b58822cf27f74234f6afc01db21fca15b480bf43634ae725db35047dc5a

## Importing a Magento shop

1. Add a hosts entry for the Docker:

```bash
grep -q hypernode.hypernode.local /etc/hosts || echo "172.17.0.2 hypernode.hypernode.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

2. Start an SSH agent and add your key:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add # Add your keys
```

3. Log in to the hypernode-docker container:

```bash
# Log in with SSH agent forwarding
# The default password is 'insecure_docker_ssh_password', or use the insecure key
ssh -A root@172.17.0.2
```

4. Double-check you are in the Docker environment and not the real Hypernode:

```console
app@e4b7d958e69c:~$ ls /etc/hypernode/is_docker
/etc/hypernode/is_docker
```

5. Import application

Run the [hypernode-importer](../../hypernode-platform/tools/how-to-migrate-your-shop-to-hypernode.md#option-2-for-all-customers-migrate-your-shop-via-shell-using-the-hypernode-importer) to import a shop from a real Hypernode:

```bash
hypernode-importer --host yourhypernode.hypernode.io --path /data/web/public --set-default-url
```

6. Point your browser to the importer shop:

Go to <http://hypernode.hypernode.local/>

## Adding keys to Container

To create a Docker instance of hypernode-docker with your own keys, create a directory with your public key in it and a Dockerfile.

```console
$ ls
key.pub Dockerfile
$ cat Dockerfile
FROM docker.hypernode.com/byteinternet/hypernode-docker:latest
MAINTAINER yourname

ADD key.pub /tmp/key.pub
RUN cat /tmp/key.pub > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys && cat /tmp/key.pub > /data/web/.ssh/authorized_keys && rm -f /tmp/deployment.pub
```

Then build the Docker with:

```bash
docker build -t hypernode-with-keys .
```

And once finished, start the Docker with

```bash
docker run hypernode-with-keys
```

Note: remember that you will also need to change the default app and root user passwords if you're looking to create a secure environment.

## Inspecting Emails Sent from The Docker

Like in the [hypernode-vagrant](https://github.com/ByteInternet/hypernode-vagrant#mail) project, all emails are caught and redirected to a [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) instance. You can visit the mailhog web interface on port `8025`. So for example, if the IP of your container is `172.17.0.2` you would be able to access MailHog on <http://172.17.0.2:8025/>.

Alternatively you could set up a hosts entry like so on the host (not in the Docker):

```bash
grep -q hypernode.hypernode.local /etc/hosts || echo "172.17.0.2 hypernode.hypernode.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

And then visit the MailHog instance on [http://hypernode.hypernode.local:8025](http://hypernode.hypernode.local:8025/).

## Installing Magento 1

Make sure you have a hosts entry set up:

```bash
# Note that you need root to write to /etc/hosts
grep -q hypernode.hypernode.local /etc/hosts || echo "172.17.0.2 hypernode.hypernode.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

Switch to a Magento 1 compatible PHP version

```console
# Log in as root
$ ssh root@172.17.0.2 -i keys/insecure_key
# Change the PHP service version to 7.0
sed -i 's/7\.1/7.0/g' /etc/my_init.d/60_restart_services.sh
# Update PHP symlinks
update-alternatives --set php $(which php7.0)
# Restart services
bash /etc/my_init.d/60_restart_services.sh
# Log out of the Docker
exit
```

Log in to the container as the app user

```bash
ssh app@172.17.0.2 -i keys/insecure_key
```

Remove any Magento 2 specific NGINX configuration

```bash
rm -rf /data/web/nginx/magento2.flag
```

Create a new database:

```bash
echo 'create database magento;' | mysql
```

Install Magento with [n98-magerun](https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun):

```bash
# Write the n98-magerun config file:

## Varnish on Docker

By default Varnish is already enabled, but won’t work because the server is missing some configuration in order to work correctly. This isn’t implemented because there were earlier issues with Varnish on a Vagrant environment.

If you want to experiment with Varnish in your Docker environment you should overwrite the content of “/etc/nginx/outside.conf”, to do this you need to log in as root user:

```bash
# Log in as the root user
ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -p 222 root@127.0.0.1
```

Overwrite the content of “/etc/nginx/outside.conf” to the following:

```nginx
## This file defines the vhosts that are facing outward (port 80 / 443 for public, 8880 and 8888 / 8443 for staging).
# This is the auto server definition for docroot public
server {
    # Log nullbytes in checkout pages post bodies
    access_by_lua_file "/etc/nginx/request_security.lua";

    ## default vhost definition
    # we need to define multiple ports because there is no overlap between what is allowed by some external services (cloudflare and adyen)
    listen 80 default_server;

    # Outside.conf will pass remote_addr to fastcgi as remote_addr, but inside.conf must
    # pass http_x_real_ip. In order to still share the fastcgi_params file inside an include
    # inside an include, we set this variable to remote_addr and set it to something else in inside.conf.
    root /data/web/public;
    ## i'm redirecting to varnish here!
    location / {
        set $log_handler varnish;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6081;
        proxy_read_timeout 900s; # equal to fastcgi_read_timeout at handlers.conf:16
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    }
    include /etc/nginx/security.conf;
    # phpmyadmin should never pass through Varnish, so include an alias and a handler here
    include /etc/nginx/phpmyadmin.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/app/public.*;
    include /etc/nginx/app/server.*;
    # in case the user wants to route a part of the site directly to FPM in override files
    include /etc/nginx/handlers.conf;
    # blocking bots tool
    include /etc/nginx/server.blocked_bots.conf;
}

# This is the auto server definition for docroot staging
server {
    # Log nullbytes in checkout pages post bodies
    access_by_lua_file "/etc/nginx/request_security.lua";

    ## default vhost definition
    # we need to define multiple ports because there is no overlap between what is allowed by some external services (cloudflare and adyen)
    listen 8880 default_server;
    listen 8888;

    # Outside.conf will pass remote_addr to fastcgi as remote_addr, but inside.conf must
    # pass http_x_real_ip. In order to still share the fastcgi_params file inside an include
    # inside an include, we set this variable to remote_addr and set it to something else in inside.conf.
    root /data/web/staging;
    # Set a default document root, and store it in a variable. This variable will be used in the
    # named location '@fastcgi_backend' to set the documentroot from which PHP-files will be served.
    # This is needed to be able to change the documentroot for phpmyadmin later on.
    include /etc/nginx/security.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/magento.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/phpmyadmin.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/app/server.*;
    # Cannot use an Nginx var in include statements. -WdG
    # This line will include staging.* and public.* files if they exist.
    include /etc/nginx/app/staging.*;

    # blocking bots tool
    include /etc/nginx/server.blocked_bots.conf;
}
```

## Restart Services

Restart the services after you changed the config file.

`bash /etc/my_init.d/60_restart_services.sh`

That’s it, Varnish should be working fine now! You can see the results when you enter ‘varnishhist’ in the CLI and click around in your webshop at <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>
