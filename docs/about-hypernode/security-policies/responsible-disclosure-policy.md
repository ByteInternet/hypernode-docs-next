# Responsible Disclosure Policy

Security is a core priority at Hypernode. We highly value the work of ethical hackers and security researchers who help us protect our systems and our users. If you’ve discovered a potential vulnerability, we would love to hear about it through the Intigriti platform.
**Important**: We only accept vulnerability submissions via our Intigriti bug bounty program. Reports sent via email or other means will not be eligible for a bounty.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

We’ve partnered with [Intigriti](https://www.intigriti.com/), a trusted bug bounty platform, to handle all responsible disclosure submissions. Our program is private, so you’ll need to be invited before you can submit a report.
To request access, simply e-mail us your Intigriti username at [security@nl.team.blue](mailto:security@nl.team.blue).

Once invited, you’ll be able to access our Intigriti program, where you’ll find:

- A detailed list of in-scope and out-of-scope systems
- Rules of engagement for security testing
- Submission guidelines
- Potential rewards for eligible findings

## Scope
You can find the current scope and testing guidelines directly on our Intigriti page.


## What We Expect
We ask all researchers to follow these basic rules:


If you play by the rules, we commit to:

- Reviewing your report promptly.
- Keeping you informed about progress.
- Rewarding you when appropriate.
- Never taking legal action against responsible researchers.

## Why Intigriti?
Using Intigriti benefits both sides:
* A secure and trusted platform for disclosure of vulnerabilities.
* Structured communication and feedback.
* Bounty rewards for accepted reports and easy payout.
* Optional anonymity for researchers.
By centralizing our vulnerability handling with Intigriti, we ensure a smooth, fair, and secure process for everyone involved.
Thanks for helping us make Hypernode more secure for all our users.
We appreciate your time, your skills, and your ethical approach.
