# Data Protection FAQ for merchants

## Does a change in (data) storage location, outside the EU impact me and / or my clients?

No, The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict requirements
on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU. Some of our products will now be provided by
one of our UK team.blue group companies. Transferring data to the UK requires ensuring that the
UK provides an adequate level of data protection. We ensure that our Clientâ€™s data will be
protected in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and that appropriate security
measures are in place to safeguard the data.

## Does a change in (data) storage location from the EU to the UK impact the way data is being handled / processed?

No. From 31 December 2020, the UK ceased to be a member of the EU. There may be
circumstances, depending on your location, where your Personal Data is transferred from the EU to
the UK. We will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to your Personal Data by ensuring
at least one of the approved safeguards are implemented and ensure that your Personal Data is
treated securely and protected against unauthorized loss or damage.
The team.blue group can improve coordination and resource allocation by sharing data internally.
This allows for more efficient collaboration on products.

## Should merchants change their own terms/policies on their websites because the data will be stored outside the EU?

Our Clients use the services to host, transmit or process data to our hosting platform and this
information may include personal data that allows their own customers to be identified. We refer to
this type of data as "Client Customer Data".
We only have a business or contractual relationship with our Clients and have no direct
relationship with the individuals categorized as Client Customer Data.
As a merchant, you retain responsibility for compliance with relevant data protection legislation,
which includes setting standards and maintaining security standards/transparency to ensure the
security of all data you upload to our platform.
As with any changes to our Terms and Conditions, we advise you to revise your contracts and
assess whether you remain compliant with relevant data protection legislation for your Customer
Data.
