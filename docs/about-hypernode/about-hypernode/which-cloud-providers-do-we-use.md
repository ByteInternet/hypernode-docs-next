# Which Cloud Providers Do We Use

Hypernode is an advanced e-commerce cloud hosting platform for webshops. The Hypernode platform is developed independently from a specific cloud provider, allowing us to choose only the best providers and switch from providers if needed. Price, location, cooperation, and infrastructure are the main aspects we consider when choosing a cloud provider. Outsourcing the hardware part of hosting enables us to focus solely on what we're good at and that is continuously improving the Hypernode technology.

## Which Cloud Providers Do We Use?

Our Hypernode platform is available to webshops worldwide. Our customers can choose from a wide range of data centers around the world.

### Combell OpenStack

After years of preparation, testing, and improvement, we started using the OpenStack platform within the Combell Group in 2018. We both are part of team.blue. Using Combell OpenStack lets us take matters into our own hands because we have direct contact with colleagues instead of a supplier.

If you order a trial or hosting plan (Falcon) your Hypernode will be booted in Ghent, Belgium.

**Advantages Combell OpenStack**

- We influence the roadmap and, therefore, have more flexibility in achieving what we want
- Combell OpenStack provides an uptime of 99.9% for the Falcon line
- In the case of incidents and issues, we have direct communication lines
- Combell OpenStack uses only the latest hardware
- Combell OpenStack offers Snapshots backups

**Disadvantages Combell OpenStack**

Combell OpenStack has only one data center in Ghent (Belgium).

### Amazon Cloud Services (AWS)

All our Hypernode Eagle plans are hosted at AWS.

Cloud provider Amazon is the market leader in web hosting. Amazon offers top quality: a very stable and innovative platform that offers Hypernode a lot of space for developing and offering intelligent and handy features on the Hypernode platform.

**Advantages AWS**

- Most stable platform of all cloud hosters
- Uptime guarantee of 99.95%
- Speedy backup process via snapshots
- Super fast and stable IOPS (Input / Output operations per second)
- Excellent maintenance policy, including good communication
- Shared storage for hypervisors. In case of issues, a reboot only takes 2 minutes

**Disadvantages AWS**

- The IOPS are not unlimited. If your shop is not well-optimized and has a lot of visitors, it may hit the limits of the Hypernode. The good news about Amazonâ€™s policy is that you will never suffer from busy neighbors :-).

## Your Hypernode in a Different Data Center

If you order a trial or hosting plan (Falcon) your Hypernode will be booted in Ghent, **Belgium**.

If you ordered a Hypernode Eagle plan, your Hypernode is booted in Frankfurt (**Germany**).

If your main target group is outside of Western Europe, you can move your shop to a different data center closer to your customers.

This can be arranged.

Email support@hypernode.com and let us know your data center of choice. Your shop will be moved manually to the new data center, depending on your agreed date and time. We only move Hypernodes during [our office hours](https://www.hypernode.com/contact-us/).

### Location of Data Centers

[**AWS:**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) N. Virginia, Frankfurt and Ireland

### Keep in Mind

Moving your Hypernode to a new data center will lead to a new IP address. You may need to change the DNS settings of your domains or whitelist the new IP address to make sure certain connections with third parties (like payment providers) keep working.
