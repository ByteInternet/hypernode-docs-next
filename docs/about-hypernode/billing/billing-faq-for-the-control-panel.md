# Billing FAQ for the Control Panel

Every first of the month, Hypernode sends an invoice to customers who placed an order in the previous month or whose plans renew in the following month. The invoices are sent digitally to the Billing contact on the first of the month. You can easily find all invoices that have been sent in the Control Panel.

## What Are the Available Payment Methods?

Our Control Panel supports two different payment methods: credit card and SEPA Direct Debit. Please see our [Supported Payment Methods in the Control Panel](supported-payment-methods-in-the-control-panel.md) article for more information.
