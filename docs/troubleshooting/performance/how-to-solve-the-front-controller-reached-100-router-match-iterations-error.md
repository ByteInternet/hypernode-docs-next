# How to solve the “Front Controller Reached 100 Router Match Iterations” Error

This error appears when a corruption in the cache arises, caused by a bug in Magento.

We see this error mostly on shops that experience high traffic, causing a rare condition in the caching mechanism.

The developers from Convenient and AmpersandHQ fully debugged this issue and came up with a patch that should solve this issue once and for all.

You can find [detailed information](https://github.com/convenient/magento-ce-ee-config-corruption-bug#the-fix) about how to solve this issue on the GitHub page of Convenient.

This issue is as far as we know a Magento 1 only issue, although a very small group of developers working on Magento 2 have notified us of having the same issue appear in Magento 2.

**Update:** So it seems it could help [changing the permissions on certain a PHP file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6262129/magento-front-controller-reached-100-router-match-iterations-error/33684913#33684913) if the convenient patch does not fix this issue.
