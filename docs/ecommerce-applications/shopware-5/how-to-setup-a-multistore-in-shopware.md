# How to Setup a Multistore in Shopware

Just like a Magento webshop you might like to use a single Shopware installation for several domains or shops. This way you can address customers from different countries by serving their native language and currency settings on the shop. This can all be realised by adding as much language and/or sub shops as you need.

## Differences Between Main Shop, Subshop and Language shop

To be able to serve different content you should, depending on what you need, create at least one subshop or language shop. If you want to serve a whole other domain you should create a subshop. But if you want to want to serve a different language you can add a language shop. This language shop will for example be served like `/en` or `/nl`

### Main Shop

The main shop is the default shop that's installed on Shopware and mandatory for each installation.

### Subshop

A subshop is just be what you need if you like to use the Shopware installation for several domains. Subshops are independent from the Main-shop and make use of their own template(s) and data which can be configured on a separate domain. For example you could have the following setup:

- Main shop: `hypernode.com`
- Subshop: `byte.nl`

### Language Shop

A language shop allows you to serve different languages for the Main and/of a subshop but with the same template. You can setup a virtual url for your language shops which allows you to reach every language shop via their own url. For example you can setup the mainshop, a subshop and language shops like this:

- Main shop: `hypernode.com`
- Language shop: `hypernode.com/de`
- Language shop: `hypernode.com/nl`
- Subshop: `byte.nl`
- Language shop: `byte.nl/en`

## How to Setup a Subshop or Language Shop

The backend provides a page from which you're able to setup and manage your multishop. You can find these settings by logging into the backend: "exampleshop.nl/backend" and navigate to `Configuration` -> `Basic settings` -> `Shop settings` -> `Shops`.

This page will provide you with an overview of all the available shops. From here you can manage your multishop by adding extra sub/language shops and manage the settings.

To add a subshop or language click on `Add entry`, make sure you edit the following details for your desired shop and click the `Save` button:
